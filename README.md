The inherent uncertainty in travel forecasting models — arising from errors in input data, parameter   estimation, or model formulation — is receiving increasing attention from the scholarly and practicing community. In this research, we investigate the variance in forecasted traffic volumes resulting from varying the mode and destination choice parameters in an advanced trip-based travel demand model. Using Latin hypercube sampling to construct several hundred combinations of parameters across the plausible parameter space, we introduce substantial changes to mode and destination choice logsums and probabilities. However, the aggregate effects of of these changes on forecasted traffic volumes is small, with a variance of approximately 1 percent on high-volume facilities.
