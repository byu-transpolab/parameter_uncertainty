  abstract: | 
    The inherent uncertainty in travel forecasting models — arising from errors 
    in input data, parameter   estimation, or model formulation — is receiving 
    increasing attention from the scholarly and practicing community. 
    In this research, we investigate the variance in forecasted traffic volumes 
    resulting from varying the mode and destination choice parameters in an 
    advanced trip-based travel demand model. Using Latin hypercube sampling to 
    construct several hundred combinations of parameters across the plausible 
    parameter space, we introduce substantial changes to mode and destination 
    choice logsums and probabilities. However, the aggregate effects of of these 
    changes on forecasted traffic volumes is small, with a variance of 
    approximately 1 percent on high-volume facilities. Thus, parameter 
    uncertainty does not appear to be a significant factor in forecasting 
    traffic volumes using transportation demand models.
