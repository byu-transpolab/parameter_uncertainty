\title{Evaluating the Impacts of Parameter Uncertainty in a Practical Transportation Demand Model}

\section{Reviewer \#1}

\subsection{Introduction}
\RC Introduction should more clearly state objectives of this study, especially the specific issues regarding impacts of parameter uncertainty in traffic demand model on prediction results. The current description is a bit vague, and it is recommended to add more explanations on the importance and practical significance of the study.


\subsection{Application Context}
\RC In literature review, authors are advised to cite relevant literature to expand the application context of traffic model. For example, doi.org/10.1016/j.physa.2024.12954.

\AR The DOI link supplied by the reviewer was malformed, and we are therefore unable to respond to this comment.

\subsection{Model Design}
\RC In Model Design and Methodology, author is advised to provide more detailed model construction process, assumptions, and specific application of the selected method (such as LHS).

\subsection{Sampling Methodology}
\RC The authors selected the LHS and MC methods for uncertainty design, but did not describe the rationale and advantages of selecting these methods. It is recommended that the authors add a description of the study method selection process, including the consideration and rationale for the exclusion of other potential methods.

\subsection{Data collection}
\RC The source and preprocessing process of the data used are not clearly stated in this paper. It is recommended to add a detailed description of the data collection, cleaning, and processing methods.
