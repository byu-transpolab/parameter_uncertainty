# Conclusions

## Overview

In general, this research has shown that statistical parameter uncertainty does not appear to be a significant factor in forecasting traffic volumes using transportation demand models. The result uncertainty is generally equally to or smaller than the input parameter variance. The described model is most confident in auto trip distributions, and on higher volume facilities. Any variation in mode and destination choice probabilities appears to be corrected by the limitations of the highway network assignment.

## Limitations and Further Research

There are several limitations that must be mentioned in this research, however. First, we did not attempt to address the statistical uncertainty in trip rate estimates; these may play a substantially larger role than destination and mode choice parameters, given that lower trip rates may lead to lower traffic volumes globally, which could not be “corrected” by the static user equilibrium assignment. And the assignment itself might have been aided in this case by the RVTPO’s relatively simplistic highway network: if only two major interstates exist the number of realistic lowest cost path choices between regions is somewhat constrained. It may be that in a larger network with more path redundancies, the assignment may not have been as helpful in constraining the forecasted volumes.

In this research we had only the estimates of the statistical coefficients, and therefore had to assume a coefficient of variation to derive variation in the sampling procedure. It would be better if model user and development documentation more regularly provided estimates of the standard errors of model parameters. Even better would be variance-covariance matrices for the estimated models, enabling researchers to ensure that covariance relationships between sampled parameters are maintained. The parameters were also varied without respect to the other parameters. The parameters are often related to one another, additional research should be done to see how an increase in correlated parameters effect the model results.

## Summary

Notwithstanding these limitations, statistical parameter variance is not likely the largest source of uncertainty in travel forecasting. There are likely more important factors at play that planners and government agencies should address. Research on all sources of uncertainty is somewhat limited, but in many ways has been hampered by the burdensome computational requirements of many modern travel models [@voulgaris2019crystal]. This research methodology benefited from a lightweight travel model that could be repeatedly re-run with dozens of resampled choice parameters. Better understanding the other sources of uncertainty -- model specification and input accuracy -- might also benefit from lightweight models constructed for transparency and flexibility rather than heavily constrained models emphasizing precise spatial detail and strict behavioral constraints. This might allow forecasts to be made with an ensemble approach [@wu2021ensemble], identifying preferred policies as the consensus of multiple plausible model specifications.
