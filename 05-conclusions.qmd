# Conclusions {#sec-conclusions}

In general, this research has shown that statistical parameter
uncertainty does not appear to be a significant factor in forecasting
traffic volumes using transportation demand models. Any variation in
mode and destination choice probabilities appears to be corrected by the
limitations of the highway network assignment.

There are several limitations that must be mentioned in this research,
however. First, we did not attempt to address the statistical
uncertainty in trip rate estimates; these may play a substantially
larger role than destination and mode choice parameters, given that
lower trip rates may lead to lower traffic volumes globally, which could
not be "corrected" by the static user equilibrium assignment. And the
assignment itself might have been aided in this case by the RVTPO's
relatively simplistic highway network: if only two major interstates
exist the number of realistic lowest cost path choices between regions
is somewhat constrained. It may be that in a larger network with more
path redundancies, the assignment may not have been as helpful in
constraining the forecasted volumes.

In this research we had only the estimates of the statistical
coefficients, and therefore had to assume a coefficient of variation to
derive variation in the sampling procedure. It would be better if model
user and development documentation more regularly provided estimates of
the standard errors of model parameters. Even better would be
variance-covariance matrices for the estimated models, enabling
researchers to ensure that covariance relationships between sampled
parameters are maintained.

Notwithstanding these limitations, statistical parameter variance is not
likely the largest source of uncertainty in travel forecasting. Research
on all sources of uncertainty is somewhat limited, but in many ways has
been hampered by the burdensome computational requirements of many
modern travel models [@voulgaris2019] . This research methodology
benefited from a lightweight travel model that could be repeatedly
re-run with dozens of resampled choice parameters. Better understanding
the other sources of uncertainty --- model specification and input
accuracy --- might also benefit from lightweight models constructed for
transparency and flexibility rather than heavily constrained models
emphasizing precise spatial detail and strict behavioral constraints.
This might allow forecasts to be made with an ensemble approach @wu2021,
identifying preferred policies as the consensus of multiple plausible
model specifications.
